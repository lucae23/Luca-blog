#### Solar system
For our first task using Unity we designed a solar system, using textures downloaded from the internet. It was quite simple and I was able to arrange the planets and apply the textures very easily. I then wanted to make the sun as the light source, and I was able to do this which gave all the planets a dark side and it was very effective. However the sun had no light and was invisible, and with my limited knowledge I didn't know how to make it light up, whilst also being a light source, so if I want to do something like this in my project I will have to research.

#### My concept
I brainstormed a few ideas, with a leading idea being the last few years when I began seeing my girlfriend, as this has been a big emotional as well as physical change due to how much I have been in the new space of her house. However I decided I don't feel this as so much of a change, but just a natural progression of my life, so I went with a very distinct change I had, when I moved schools in year 9.

My concept will be on when I moved schools, as reflecting on this time I feel I had some of my biggest personal changes, as well as I have distinct memories of the spatial changes I experienced. I want to show my audience the almost dream-like memories I have of my old school, and then the anxiety of moving into a new space. I believ instead of trying to show how the schools actually were, I want to convey my association and feelings with the spaces, as if this is a dream of mine.

#### Assets
As I will be showing the space of a school, I need 3D assets of lockers, doors, stairwells and all objects making the interior of a hallway or classroom. I will need the textures of hallway floors, walls, glass and carpet, which I will probably source all from the internet as these are all quite simple textures and aren't that specific. I will need sounds such as the chatter of students, and the squeeking of hallways, which again I will most likely source online.

#### My environment
I have two distinct environments; my two schools, and want to morph from the old one to the new one. The environment for the old one will be eerie and darker, with light creeping in from the windows, as this is how I now picture that space. I'm thinking maybe a green colour pallette, with warmer colours from the light, as I do want some positive nostalgic elements present. The sound design for this school will be extremely quiet and relaxed, I want it to feel empty. When the environment begins to change I want the colours to become brighter, partly to show how I have moved past a more emotional time, however also to display the new anxiety and stress of the next space. I'm hoping the first space is calm and somber, making the audience slightly unsettled and sad, and when the environment warps they begin to feel more overwhelmed.

#### My plan
This is an idea for how my players move through the space, with each door showing a space that is gradually tranforming. They will also be able to peer into spaces around them, that will give them more infomation.
