#### My Paragraphs

This is my video project for assignment 1, which depicts a self portrait through it's visual and sonic elements. I wanted the audience to gain an understanding of my interests, feelings and personality. I displayed a sequence of different shots, depicting objects and ideas that represented who I am, and combined it with an original soundtrack performed by me on drums. I wanted the video to be fun and have a strong rhythm, and finally erupting in an montage of loud sounds and sharp cuts, shocking the audience and inviting them to reassess the beginning of the video.

These are my eight interactive icons for assignment 2, which are displayed on a webpage. Each icon share a bright, primary colour scheme, aimed to make them look friendly and inviting, and all have a unique sound that plays when clicked on, as well as a change in appearance. The icons all relate to the theme of 'home', a space where someone lives and resides, with the icons all meant to represent a certain aspect of ones home, from the physical building, different rooms, and to the pets that inhabit a home. 

My assignment 3 was an explorable 3D environment of a school. It depicted an interpretation of my old high school, intended to come across as surreal and dream-like, and attempted to convey a meaninful and personal change I experienced through its sonic and visual components. The change I showed was my journey maturing through high school, up to the point where I was faced with the reality of life after the stability of school, and this being both a daunting and desired experience. I created this through my construction of the physical space, specifically the warm, moody lighting, and the tunnel-like hallways, combined with eerie sound effects and a somber soundtrack that formed an emotional atmosphere.

#### My artist bio draft
I am Luca, a multimedia creative practitioner from Naarm/Melbourne, Australia. I am currently completing a Bachelor of Design in Digital Media at the RMIT University, and I have worked with a variety of digital and non-digital media outside of this course. This includes working on video production, web design, game design and songwriting among other areas.

My work is loud, fun and exciting. I enjoy working with strong, bold colours, and placing most importance in creating strong dynamics. However with all my work, the bright and bold appearance is created with an emotional and conscious purpose, with much of the dynamics of the work inspired by the important relationship of differing emotions, that can be seen throughout my media.
