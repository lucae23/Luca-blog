I finalised my icons, considering my audience and their needs. Some things I edited where making some icons less broad, for instance I changed the garage icon to a car icon. As garage doesn't just represent a place to hold a car, it can mean a storage or a gym space too. This means my audience can easily identify this signifies cars and home transport, whereas the garage may not have been as clear. The car is also a much stronger and clearer image.

Here are my final designs:

I started working on my second images for the icons. For some I was able to jump in illustrator and do it in a flash, such as the toilet, because all I did was simply largen the lid, and add an outline.

I experimented with different alternates, for instance originally I had the cat open it's mouth, however I aimed to make all the movements as simple and smooth looking as possible, which meant making more basic alternate designs. I considered my audience once again, who I know are using these icons to be directed around a home-oriented site, so I didn't want to confuse them. For instance I wanted the alternate designs to have a meaningful change that related to their real-world counterpart, such as the car flashing it's horns. I wanted to immerse my audience in the icons to best connect them to the objects they represent, as opposed to making pointless aesthetic choices like making the car change colour.
