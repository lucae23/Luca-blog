I finalised my icons, considering my audience and their needs. Some things I edited where making some icons less broad, for instance I changed the garage icon to a car icon. As garage doesn't just represent a place to hold a car, it can mean a storage or a gym space too. This means my audience can easily identify this signifies cars and home transport, whereas the garage may not have been as clear. The car is also a much stronger and clearer image.
