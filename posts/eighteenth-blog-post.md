#### Feedback
I posted my environment to discord and got some feedback for it. One main problem is whilst the environment was quite immersive and well designed, the change was not very strong, and this I knew, I really struggled with coming up with how to show change in the environment, partly due to how many problems I faced in actually designing it. Some other feedback was it was lacking music, which could really add to the emotion, which I considered and implemented. I found some somber ambient music online for free, and added into the enviornment, and combined with the sfx already added it really enhanced my project.

I also recieved feedback that suggested adding a portal, as not only does this just make my environment much more interesting, but it could also really create a change that my project is lacking. I first tried a portal that just eluded to somewhere else to go, however this wasn't enough, so I knew I needed to try make a portal you could look into and see a change, but not yet quite access. It would be a final statement to really bring up the quality of my project, and it fits, as my final moment is meant to be a positive, optimistic change in emotion, yet with an undertone of somberness, and so if you were able to see this positive change, yet not access it, both goals would be achieved.

I searched up how to make an advanced portal, where I could see a new location through the portal, and attempted to understand how to add this to my environment. However, I quickly realised how complicated it, and thought if there were any alternatives to this. I applied desingn thinking as I prototyped the advanced portal before realizing its difficulty, and then I came up with the simple solution to just decrease the opacity of the portal, and build an environment on the other side, so it appears that you are looking onto a new space, but it is really just right in front of you. This worked so well, and I was very proud of my idea. I made the outside environment look natural, added nature audio sfx, and rotated the skybox so the sun was behind it all.

Overall I know I could've done better with this project, I definitely put a lot of time and effor into the environment, however a lot of the work hasn't shown, due to a number of reasons such as coding that I just couldn't figure out, such as opening doors. The change of my environment ironically changed too. Originally I wanted the school building to change features so that it showed an emotional change through colour and object alterations, however whilst I did attempt some of this, It just wasn't enough, so after feedback I added the final change at the end being the portal. This meant instead of showing a change in schools, my final intention was more my personal change as I matured throughout high school, with the final environment seen in the portal showing the exciting and beautiful world after high school, yet the ominous sounds and barred access demonstrating how uncertain the future is, which I felt in my last year of school. Whilst this project was a minor failure, I learned a lot about using Unity, and a lot about the designing process.
