#### Feedback
I posted my environment to discord and got some feedback for it. One main problem is whilst the environment was quite immersive and well designed, the change was not very strong, and this I knew, I really struggled with coming up with how to show change in the environment, partly due to how many problems I faced in actually designing it. Some other feedback was it was lacking music, which could really add to the emotion, which I considered and implemented. I found some somber ambient music online for free, and added into the enviornment, and combined with the sfx already added it really enhanced my project.

I also recieved feedback that suggested adding a portal, as not only does this just make my environment much more interesting, but it could also really create a change that my project is lacking. I first tried a portal that just eluded to somewhere else to go, however this wasn't enough, so I knew I needed to try make a portal you could look into and see a change, but not yet quite access. It would be a final statement to really bring up the quality of my project, and it fits, as my final moment is meant to be a positive, optimistic change in emotion, yet with an undertone of somberness, and so if you were able to see this positive change, yet not access it, both goals would be achieved.
