#### Feedback
I posted my environment to discord and got some feedback for it. One main problem is whilst the environment was quite immersive and well designed, the change was not very strong, and this I knew, I really struggled with coming up with how to show change in the environment, partly due to how many problems I faced in actually designing it. Some other feedback was it was lacking music, which could really add to the emotion, which I considered and implemented. I found some somber ambient music online for free, and added into the enviornment, and combined with the sfx already added it really enhanced my project.
