### Pen Tool Games
In class we completed some games and challenges, deisgned to improve our pen skills. This was the Bezier game and two challenges. It helped me understand how to curve lines, and use the option key, which proved extremly useful when it came to designing my icons, as I hadn't used illustrator before.

### Icon Designs
The following are my desings for four of my icons, they go from monochromatic, and then a different colour is added for each design. I think for most of them the more monochromatic and less coloured designs were more effective. This is due to some of the icons being such simple icons, such as a fridge, which really needs no colour.
I think for the bed the red one was the most effective, this is because I feel like red is probably more synonymous with bedsheets than blue. Monochromatic was also better for the blue, as I could have added more colours with the pillowsm but it wasn't necessary to define the object as being a bed.
For the TV I went for monochromatic also, which is because I had such strong uses of shade with the white and black, I didn't think I needed any more colours in the mix.
Finally for the controller, I went with the most colourful design, as the colours were simply the buttons, so It wasn't too distracting regardless.
