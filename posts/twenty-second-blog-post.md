#### Webpage Accessability
I used the contrast checker website to see if my text and backround was an appropriate contrast for reading, and it wasn't. So I darkened the backround and this was an easy fix. My next step as making the website more accesable was adding a grid layout. I already was following roughly in a grid form, but I added a 12 bar column grid and perfectly alligned it.

#### Progress
My design is coming along well and I decided to add a little bit about my out-of-uni interests. I make artworks out of cutting up paper and sticking them together, and thought I'd include some of these artworks, because they show a foundation to my creative designs this semester. My use of bold colours can be seen in the artworks, and they closely reflect my icons I designed, so I think they are perfect to include, to show both my creativity but an insight into my inspirations.
