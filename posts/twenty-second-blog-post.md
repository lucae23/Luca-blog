#### Webpage Accessability
I used the contrast checker website to see if my text and backround was an appropriate contrast for reading, and it wasn't. So I darkened the backround and this was an easy fix. My next step as making the website more accesable was adding a grid layout. I already was following roughly in a grid form, but I added a 12 bar column grid and perfectly alligned it.
