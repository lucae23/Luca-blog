#### Adding audio to my icons
In this session I considered sound effects that would fit with my icon designs, and how to record them. I figured sourcing them from copyright-free sound librarys would be better, as they would be high quality recordings that were easier to access. However I found it difficult to find certain sounds I wanted, such as the fridge sound, so I recorded that myself with my own fridge. I edited all the audio files in Adobe Audition, as for some I only wanted one part of a very long clip, and then added them all into the websited using HTML. For most of my icons the sounds aligned with the 'movement' of the icons, such as the sound of bed sheets being pulled down for the bed icon. However for some I thought the real-world correlating sound was not immersive enough, such as if I had just done a click for the car lights being switched on, so I did other sounds that were connected but not always the exact sound the action made, which is how I got the car beep for the car.

#### Finalising the alternate images
I also finalised the second images for the icons I was struggling with movement for, such as the house and flower. For both icons, I couldn't think of a way that they'd be interactive like the other icons, so instead of having a part of the object move, I decided to add more objects, such as the bee appearing on the flower, and the smoke from the chimney. Whilst these designs aren't as immersive as some others, they still looked pretty good.
