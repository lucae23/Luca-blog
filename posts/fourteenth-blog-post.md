#### Greybox Prototype
I designed a very rough greybox prototype of my space, depicting the hallways and classrooms. I was worried that my space was going to be too inclosed, and not as immersive as a space that depicted more of an outside environment for example, however I realised in a smaller space I can focus on the fine details, and still achieve the goal of creating a feeling. 

I then added the character controller and began exploring the space, ensuring it felt like realistic proportions. One thing I realised whilst testing, is that is this is a memory of a school I was at when I was 12-13, it would make sense for my character to be shorter, and not the height of an adult, I think this will be a great addition to my project as it will make the school environment feel more daunting, as it obviously was for me back when I was so young.
