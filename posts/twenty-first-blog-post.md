#### Wireframing
In tonights lesson we looked at wireframing, where you roughly map out how the website will look, and where things will be placed. We first attempted making a wireframe of a website, without having any reference to it, I chose YouTubes homepage, and the below is the result:

After this attempt, we then looked at the actual website and attempted to replicate it as a wireframe, as accurately as possible.

I did another wireframe for my own website. I was happy with the design of having one image in the centre of myself, then followed by all the writing. I feel this says a lot about my style, as i'm not so much into formal writing, but rather getting the visuals, so the first object in frame being something visual is a smart idea.

 My next wireframe was not a true wireframe as it had colour and images, however it was an 'advanced wireframe' as it still acted as a prototype where I was figuring out where to put things. I continued the idea of the image in the centre being the opening point of interest, and I chose a film pic of myself drumming on stage. I chose me behind the drums, as my teacher Thomas said that it is good to include all aspects of our creative identitys, but it isn't necessary to go into detail for everything. So this way I show my audience my interest and experience in music, without writing about it, although I might touch on it in my artist bio.
 
  I also chose this photo of me on the drums over other ones due to it being on film, as digital shots looked a bit too formal and posed, and its strong colours, which fit the aesthetic of my websites bright colours. I chose my colours, being a strong red and yellow, as just as for my assignment 2 icons, these colours pop, are fun, warm and straight off the bat tell my audience so much about me, such as that I'm not super formal with my work.
