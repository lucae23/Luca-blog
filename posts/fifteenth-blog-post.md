#### Perspective Task
In this lesson we utilised a concept called anamorphosis, meaning objects are placed in different spaces, but when viewed from a certain perspective it makes an image. I made the image of a face, and this task showed me just how warped objects can look when they are placed without context, which helped when it came to placing my backround objects in my project.

#### Building on the school
I started building on my greyboxes, trying out textures and adding different models to make it look like a school. My old school was much more traditional looking, more reminiscent of an american high school, so the older wooden desks and metal lockers were perfect here. I wanted to be able to make holes in walls, so I could put things like windows and doors without breaking up the texture, so I researched ways to do this. One way said use a package called ProBuilder, so I downloaded this and tried to use it but for whatever reason I couldn't get the same pop-ups as the video was getting, so I had to give up. My solution instead was to have different copies of the texture for different size walls, and just adjust the tiling, which was not as effective, but still looked pretty consistent.

Due to my lack of ability with Unity, I prioritised building the space to look like a school over the creation of a feeling. I feel like I was succesfully able to replicate a school environment, through my uses of all different models you would find in a school. To then create a feeling I mainly used lighting. I made the only lighting for the classroom being the sunlight coming in from the windows, casting shadows on the desks, as I wanted to make the classroom look as if it was outside of school hours. The angle of the sunlight and the warm colour added to this, as it made it look like it was afternoon. The reason I wanted it to look like this, is my last memory of my old school was being in the empty hallways around 4pm, and it was a somber time, as I as leaving a place I was at for 2 years. So the harsh shadows and lack of lighting add to the sad feelings I want to show, however as I also wanted to show how good memories were still attached to my school when I left, I chose warm lighting to make the rooms feel more homely and relaxed. I want my players to feel comfortable in this first environment they are in, but due to the emptiness and unusual time for a school setting, to feel a sense of melancholy.
