The below link is to my draft of my self portrait. It has no audio, because I filmed my clips first, which for the final video I won't do, as the clips must be aligned with the drum performance, so I will record my clips second for the final video. I was very happy with how the shots came out, almost all exactly as I was intending. I set up a DIY tripod for my phone in the form of a mic stand, which was very effective for the shots of the faces, as these are match cuts, and must remain in the same position. 

The shots I had difficulty with were of the pen, as these follow the motion of the pen, so I was drawing and filming at the same time. Because of this I will ask someone in my family to hold the pen, so I can have both hands on the phone filming.

The editing process also went smoothly, I was happy how each shot looked next to eachother, I feel my ideas were reflected quite well. A difficulty I faced was how long each shot was supposed to be, but I realised that this would be fixed when I had the drum audio recorded, as then I could sync the shots with the drums, as with no audio some shots look a bit awkward.

An editing idea I came up with that I had not thought of before, was how the shots cut to black, and flash for shorter and shorter amounts of time. Originally all shots would flash for even amounts of time, but I realised with this technique I could push the assignments rules of allowing to cut to black, to the absoloute max. It creates a build up in tension, just by simply adjusting the time each shot is on screen for. Here is the link:
