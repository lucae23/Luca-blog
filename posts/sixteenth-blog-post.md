#### Sound in Unity
In this session I added sound to my project. Firstly I added sounds of footsteps, so that when you pressed W, A, S, or D, the sound of feet stepping on floorboards could be heard. I went onto RMIT ProSounds and got some free audio, and then watched a YouTube tutorial on adding sound. The video gave me some script to write, which I copied down and added to my Player Controller in Unity, and to my absolute delight worked first try. The reason I added this sound as it was materialization, I wanted the players to know that the floor was 'real' wood, that responded like a floor would, in order to immerse my audience in the environment.

I also added an ambience sound, which was as simple as draggin some audio into the Unity project. I used some ambience of children in a playground, to make it seem like after-school care was on. I made the sound 3D, and added setting so the further away from the window you got, the lower the volume was, so that it felt as if the sound was coming through the window.

This also was a technique to materialize my project, in order to further immerse my audience in the environment. The distant sounds also help amplify my dream-like depiction of the school, as I whilst I want my audience to feel as though this is a real place, I still want an element of abnormality to be present.
