These are the storyboards for my self portrait video. I will maintain continuity as I will have the recurring image of the face that morphs over time, showing its linear progression, while intercut with other objects. I will then maintain discontinuity, as at the climax of the video the face starts changing rapidly in a non-linear manner. I make this change to show to the audience how identity is not a simple concept such as the drawing of a face, but it is many faces that combine together to form a greater identity. The jarring cuts are also meant to surprise and agitate the audience, as this part of identity is more angry and uncontrollable, compared to the very controlled and calm face in the first part of the video. 

The video begins with an L cut, which shows a cymbal being struck creating digetic sound, and the audio of the drums then continues throughout the video, becoming a non-diagetic soundtrack. I chose to do this, as opposed to never featuring the visual of the drums, as not only are the drums important to the rhthym of the video, but they are a massive part of my own identity, so I thought it was important to show the visual as well as audio. I am using materialization by to show that the drums are a real presence in my self portrait, and not simply a backround sound, which I do by attaching the sound of the cymbal crashing, with the visual of the cymbal being hit. It also creates a much more interesting intro for the video. I also use match cuts at the end with all of the faces, I did this as I am trying to convey all the faces belong to one singular identity, but it also allows for the viewers focus to remain in the centre during the fast edits.
