## Here is a link to a short editing experiment of mine: (https://vimeo.com/921667820)
When I first swapped footages with my classmate, I was shocked at how different both clips were. Mine was static, silent and without any movement in frame, whereas theres moved all through a space, was loud and had many moving elements, notably the people in the space. This extreme constrast inspired me to experiment with swapping the audios of both clips, so that the moving video was quiet, and the static video loud, as I was interested in the feelings this would envoke. After the swap I discovered that there was a very eerie vibe in the moving shot, and an unsettling vibe in the static cam, and I decided then that the aim of my experiement would be to create a strange, hostile environment, arising from the combination of two polar opposite spaces. I supported the effect of the audio swap by using slow motion, and finishing the clip with an abrupt, loud end, to make my viewer shocked and uncomfortable, and overall, I think I achieved at the creation of an unsettling atmosphere in my experiment.
