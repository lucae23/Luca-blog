#### Self Reflection Questions

#### Assignment 1

##### How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?

The sonic and visual elements of my edit were strongly connected, as the visuals were edited to match the rhythm of the sonic elements. The sonic aspect was a recording of myself drumming, beginning very steady and funky, and ending in an eruption of sound. I then filmed the shots I had planned, and when editing matched them up with the audio so every 2 bars their was a cut, to make a cohesive rhthym between the sonic and visual elements.

##### How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
I first considered all the physical objects and spaces that I could use to best represent myself, ranging from hobbys such as my comic books, to spaces I felt comfortable in, like my room. I narrowed down what was the most engaging, eye-catching and representative of me and chose these shots. However, I didn't want the only objects in frame to be things I simply liked or used, I wanted to have more implicit messages in my video as well, so I thought of a way I could do this. I came up with the idea of using a hobby of mine, drawing and doodling, and using this to express something a but more profound about myself, as opposed to just what I like. I wanted to express the many different parts of personality through my drawing, albeit a very obvious statement, and so I picked these shots as well.

##### What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
I would say I was aware of the power of sound to shape emotional experience, particularly the rhythm and dynamics of the drums, but I had never utilized this ability with visual elements, and so I learned just how effective sound is when it is actually put into practice. This knowledge was applied as when I wanted an emotional climax, giving feelings of chaos, I knew I had to have loud, fast and erratic sounds, which I got by playing the drums in this style, like a crazy drum solo.

##### How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? 
Editing is how the vidoes are cut and placed in a timeline, so the way they are cut and placed can impact the pacing and rhythm of a video. For instance if the shots are played for only short amounts of time, one after the other, this can make the rhythm of the video very fast and jarring. I used these concepts very deliberatlly in my video, with the first half of the video having cuts only every 4-5 seconds, and all the shots lasting the same time on screen, meaning there was a very stable and grrovy pace for this section. However when I wanted to create a more exciting mood, the cuts became much faster and random, again changing the pace to be ecstatic and in-your-face.

##### Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?
I chose to depict my interests through objects and spaces, such as music, drums, books, etc. I chose to show the more positive parts of my personality, through the overall tone of the first half, and the bright colours on screen. I then showed another aspect of my personality through the many faces, a reprentation of how my personality, like most other peoples, is very multi-faceted!!

##### What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
To show the happy, upbeat parts of myself, the mise-en-scene was bright and colourful, showing a large array of differnent objects, from the colourful pages of my comics to the shiny lamp on my desk. The climactic parts of the video were dispersed with shots of blackness, a clear sign of darkness, but the cuts of the faces lacked any colour, which I wish I changed looking back, as many different colours would have enhanced my intention of showing the many aspects of my personality.
