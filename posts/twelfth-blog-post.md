#### Final statement
My icons came out mostly successful. I am proud at my improvement using the pen tool, which I hadn't used before this, evem though it took some trial and error to get some of the icons done. The use of the shadows was inspired by the examples that we were shown in class, and I thought it was a great way to give the icons more depth and ground them, without overcrowding the icons with shapes. 

The icons were completed very quickly, as I really enjoyed just designing and experimenting, as well as the alternate designs. The only icon I wasn't completly happy with was the flower, it was the least interesting and the green was very prominent, the bee was also not very fluid looking as an alternate. However overall I feel as though I created 9 identifiable icons, that my audience can recognize and associate them with a real-life category of homeware.

The most difficult part of this for me was the coding. Using VSCode, HTML and others completly confused me and often times I was completly stuck which halted some progress, however after help from the teacher and googling, I was able to build up a basic understanding of HTML from this assignment.
