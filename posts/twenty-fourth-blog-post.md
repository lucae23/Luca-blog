#### Redesign
After other people added links to their designs, I noticed my classmates whos websites I liked the most were all very immersive. For example one of my classmates had a distinct 8-bit theme, with all the font in 8-bit, many retro icons scattered about, and all their links in the same style. I reflected on my own website, and whilst it had a colour scheme, it didn't really have a cohesive theme, which I thought would take it to the next level. This is when I thought of the idea, of incorporating my comic inspired artwork into the overall website, as opposed to just plomping them on the page, as I was doing with everything else. I added my Batman artwork and made the backround the same colour, so it looked as though my art sat on the page, and I used his speech bubble to begin my artist bio, as he states "start talking", which I thought was a good joke. I was very happy with this idea to really stick to a strong theme, instead of placing a bunch of different things on the page, and I learnt always look at what your classmates have done, as it may be a source of inspiration.
