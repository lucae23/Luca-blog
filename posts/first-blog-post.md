#### This is the gate to the old Gaol, daunting. We at first thought the 'damned' meant the dead, but figured out it was those who found themselves on the wrong side of the law.

#### These are gorilla hands, nice! The easiest on the list to find.

#### This is a vending machine, boring. It does have some cooler snacks than others

#### These are the study pods that resemble Darth Vaders chamber, actually really cool.

#### This is the black box, we found it last, after another group told us where it was.

## Week 1 Session 2
## Here is a link to a short editing experiment of mine: (https://vimeo.com/921667820)
When I first swapped footages with my classmate, I was shocked at how different both clips were. Mine was static, silent and without any movement in frame, whereas theres moved all through a space, was loud and had many moving elements, notably the people in the space. This extreme constrast inspired me to experiment with swapping the audios of both clips, so that the moving video was quiet, and the static video loud, as I was interested in the feelings this would envoke. After the swap I discovered that there was a very eerie vibe in the moving shot, and an unsettling vibe in the static cam, and I decided then that the aim of my experiement would be to create a strange, hostile environment, arising from the combination of two polar opposite spaces. I supported the effect of the audio swap by using slow motion, and finishing the clip with an abrupt, loud end, to make my viewer shocked and uncomfortable, and overall, I think I achieved at the creation of an unsettling atmosphere in my experiment.

These are the storyboards for my self portrait video. I will maintain continuity as I will have the recurring image of the face that morphs over time, showing its linear progression, while intercut with other objects. I will then maintain discontinuity, as at the climax of the video the face starts changing rapidly in a non-linear manner. I make this change to show to the audience how identity is not a simple concept such as the drawing of a face, but it is many faces that combine together to form a greater identity. The jarring cuts are also meant to surprise and agitate the audience, as this part of identity is more angry and uncontrollable, compared to the very controlled and calm face in the first part of the video. 

The video begins with an L cut, which shows a cymbal being struck creating digetic sound, and the audio of the drums then continues throughout the video, becoming a non-diagetic soundtrack. I chose to do this, as opposed to never featuring the visual of the drums, as not only are the drums important to the rhthym of the video, but they are a massive part of my own identity, so I thought it was important to show the visual as well as audio. I am using materialization to show that the drums are a real presence in my self portrait, and not simply a backround sound. It also creates a much more interesting intro for the video. I also use match cuts at the end with all of the faces, I did this as I am trying to convey all the faces belong to one singular identity, but it also allows for the viewers focus to remain in the centre during the fast edits.
## Week 2 Session 2
A key moment for my video is in the climax, when the cuts become jarring, and the drums become very complex, loud and angry. I want this moment to convey the stronger emotions that are attached to me as part of my identity, such as anger, frustratian and confusion, and so I hope the combination of the fast cuts and loud sounds achieve this. The rhythm of the drumns will be thrashing and unpredictable, to seem even more jarring when juxtaposed with the strong funky rhythm leading up. I will reinforce the anger of the audio by making fast jump cuts, that follows a non-linear chronology, further juxtaposing the first part of the video. This will utilize the principle of discontinuity, as I am not trying to show a linear progession of the drawing of the face anymore, but show the audience how the face is constantly changing and is not static.

This is an editing experiment we did in class, where I took another groups video and added my own sound onto it. I thought that there was a humorous tone to their film, as it is of someone skipping class, and they taunt their teacher. So I went on to RMITs sound library and picked out humorous sound effects. I think I was succesful at amplifying the comedy, as the lines 'school's out' sounds utterly ridiculous, and the raspberry at the end is quite funny. This experiment also was useful as I learned about exporting sound effects and adding them into the timeline, which is useful for my assignment.
## Week 3 Session 1
The below link is to my draft of my self portrait. It has no audio, because I filmed my clips first, which for the final video I won't do, as the clips must be aligned with the drum performance, so I will record my clips second for the final video. I was very happy with how the shots came out, almost all exactly as I was intending. I set up a DIY tripod for my phone in the form of a mic stand, which was very effective for the shots of the faces, as these are match cuts, and must remain in the same position. 

The shots I had difficulty with were of the pen, as these follow the motion of the pen, so I was drawing and filming at the same time. Because of this I will ask someone in my family to hold the pen, so I can have both hands on the phone filming.

The editing process also went smoothly, I was happy how each shot looked next to eachother, I feel my ideas were reflected quite well. A difficulty I faced was how long each shot was supposed to be, but I realised that this would be fixed when I had the drum audio recorded, as then I could sync the shots with the drums, as with no audio some shots look a bit awkward.

An editing idea I came up with that I had not thought of before, was how the shots cut to black, and flash for shorter and shorter amounts of time. Originally all shots would flash for even amounts of time, but I realised with this technique I could push the assignments rules of allowing to cut to black, to the absoloute max. It creates a build up in tension, just by simply adjusting the time each shot is on screen for. Here is the link:
