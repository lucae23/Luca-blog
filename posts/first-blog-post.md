#### This is the gate to the old Gaol, daunting. We at first thought the 'damned' meant the dead, but figured out it was those who found themselves on the wrong side of the law.

These are the storyboards for my self portrait video. I will maintain continuity as I will have the recurring image of the face that morphs over time, showing its linear progression, while intercut with other objects. I will then maintain discontinuity, as at the climax of the video the face starts changing rapidly in a non-linear manner. I make this change to show to the audience how identity is not a simple concept such as the drawing of a face, but it is many faces that combine together to form a greater identity. The jarring cuts are also meant to surprise and agitate the audience, as this part of identity is more angry and uncontrollable, compared to the very controlled and calm face in the first part of the video. 

The video begins with an L cut, which shows a cymbal being struck creating digetic sound, and the audio of the drums then continues throughout the video, becoming a non-diagetic soundtrack. I chose to do this, as opposed to never featuring the visual of the drums, as not only are the drums important to the rhthym of the video, but they are a massive part of my own identity, so I thought it was important to show the visual as well as audio. I am using materialization by to show that the drums are a real presence in my self portrait, and not simply a backround sound, which I do by attaching the sound of the cymbal crashing, with the visual of the cymbal being hit. It also creates a much more interesting intro for the video. I also use match cuts at the end with all of the faces, I did this as I am trying to convey all the faces belong to one singular identity, but it also allows for the viewers focus to remain in the centre during the fast edits.
## Week 2 Session 2
A key moment for my video is in the climax, when the cuts become jarring, entering a montage state, and the drums become very complex, loud and angry. I want this moment to convey the stronger emotions that are attached to me as part of my identity, such as anger, frustratian and confusion, and so I hope the combination of the fast cuts and loud sounds achieve this. The rhythm of the drumns will be thrashing and unpredictable, to seem even more jarring when juxtaposed with the strong funky rhythm leading up. I will reinforce the anger of the audio by making fast jump cuts, that follows a non-linear chronology, further juxtaposing the first part of the video. This will utilize the principle of discontinuity, as I am not trying to show a linear progession of the drawing of the face anymore, but show the audience how the face is constantly changing and is not static.

This is an editing experiment we did in class, where I took another groups video and added my own sound onto it. I thought that there was a humorous tone to their film, as it is of someone skipping class, and they taunt their teacher. So I went on to RMITs sound library and picked out humorous sound effects. I think I was succesful at amplifying the comedy, as the lines 'school's out' sounds utterly ridiculous, and the raspberry at the end is quite funny. This experiment also was useful as I learned about exporting sound effects and adding them into the timeline, which is useful for my assignment.
## Week 3 Session 1
The below link is to my draft of my self portrait. It has no audio, because I filmed my clips first, which for the final video I won't do, as the clips must be aligned with the drum performance, so I will record my clips second for the final video. I was very happy with how the shots came out, almost all exactly as I was intending. I set up a DIY tripod for my phone in the form of a mic stand, which was very effective for the shots of the faces, as these are match cuts, and must remain in the same position. 

The shots I had difficulty with were of the pen, as these follow the motion of the pen, so I was drawing and filming at the same time. Because of this I will ask someone in my family to hold the pen, so I can have both hands on the phone filming.

The editing process also went smoothly, I was happy how each shot looked next to eachother, I feel my ideas were reflected quite well. A difficulty I faced was how long each shot was supposed to be, but I realised that this would be fixed when I had the drum audio recorded, as then I could sync the shots with the drums, as with no audio some shots look a bit awkward.

An editing idea I came up with that I had not thought of before, was how the shots cut to black, and flash for shorter and shorter amounts of time. Originally all shots would flash for even amounts of time, but I realised with this technique I could push the assignments rules of allowing to cut to black, to the absoloute max. It creates a build up in tension, just by simply adjusting the time each shot is on screen for. Here is the link:

## Week 4 Session 1
### Black squares task
For the task of the black squares, I quickly thought of the most simple, and consise choices, and recorded them. This included a simple straight line for the order category, a very obvious but effective choice. For many of my designs I used design thinking, with meant empathizing with the audience and thinking how my use of squares could evoke the feeling that was being portrayed, and an example of this was in the congested category. This design was that I put all four black squares cramped into the corner, as it creates a claustrophic feeling because of all the blank space that could be used, hopefully making the audience have the feeling of congestion too. 
![Working with black squares](/W01S1/Screenshot.jpg)
For some of the designs I thought outside of the box, and came up with alternate takes on the categorys, for instance with order, instead of an ordered design of squares, I depicted one square with a speech bubble, yelling an 'order' at another square. This was fun as I was able to be creative and come up with unique and interesting designs, however I found this required much more thinking and planning, which takes away from quickly jotting ideas, and that the messages were also not as clear, and so I had to 'kill the darlings' and pick the most consise and effective designs for my final choices.

### Brainstorming
I picked two prompts I was interested in; dreams and home, and brainstormed all the different concepts I could think of for both.
![brainstorming](/W01S1/mindmap.jpg)
For all the potential icon designs I had a website navigation system in mind, particularly on a laptop however a tablet or phone could also be appropriate. The website would be navigating different elements of a home, such as a site like IKEA that sells all different products related to a home. I also had in mind my audience, who are young and prone to quickly identify the icons, and who would be knowledgable to be reliant on the icons to direct them around the site. They would be able to relate to modern icons, particularly those inspired by emojis, and be intelligent to identify more abstract ideas presented in the icons. They wouldn't be too young however, as they are living out of home, and so my icons could not be too modern, for instance for hobby I used a retro controller, avoiding something to modern like a VR headset. Some of the more abstract ideas would be the subconsious, which I could attempt to depict as an icon. However a majority of the ideas were those objects closely related to the prompt, such as a bed and brain with dreams, or a house and tv with a home.
## Week 4 Session 2
### Thumbnail Sketch 1
![house sketches](/W01S1/almosthouse.png)
I did 20 thumbnail sketches of a 'house' in illustrator, that all had the similiar design of a box and a roof, and often a door. I think the most effective one is the house on the very bottom to the left, as it is one of the most simple, yet is so clear that it's a house, with all the shapes in the design being proportinate with eachother.
![house sketches](/W01S1/houses.png)
### Thumbnail Sketch 2
![sketches](/W01S1/sketches.JPG)
For these sketches I decided to handdraw them instead of using illustrator, because it is easier for me at this stage. 

I think the best design for bed is the 4th one. It uses less shapes than some others where I included the bed legs too, and so I think structurally it is easier to look at and identify it.

I think the best design for the house is 2nd one. This is because it has much less lines that the other designs, which means the eye doesn't wander to too many shapes so they can quickly identify it as a house.

I think the best design for the fridge is the 1st one. It literally has just 2 shapes, making it very simple and clear, as I added some fridge magnet shapes to one design but all it does it make it more crowded.

I think the best design for the tv is the 2nd one. This one is close with the 1st design, but I went for the more retro TV, as the shape is more simple, being just a square instead of a rectangle and a stand. I feel it directs attention to be more compact, meaning the eye wanders around less.

I think the best design for the toilet is the 3rd one. It is symetrical and simple, whereas some others have a different perspective, and as all my other favourite icons are symettrical, I think this stays in line.

I think the best design for the garage is the 1st one. I couldnt think of too many options for this design, but this one in particular has minimal shapes making it simple, and the horizontal lines firmly stabilize the icon, and convey that it's a garage.

I think the best design for the hobby is the game controller. This is because the others are very cluttered with lines and are not symettrical, and the ones that are I don't think clearly conveys the topic of 'hobby'. The controller has a strong shape, with the curvy lines making it appear friendly and inviting.

I think the best design for the garden one is the 1st flower. The petals are curvy again conveying friendlyness, as opposed to the less organic designs that have jagged edges, and for the topic 'garden', it should look as organic as it can be.

I think the best design for the pet is the cat face. The dynamics of the circle face and triangle ears encapture the feelings we have about our pets, and the design is the most clear, as opposed to a bone or collar which can be interpreted much differently.
## Week 5 Session 1
### Pen Tool Games
In class we completed some games and challenges, deisgned to improve our pen skills. This was the Bezier game and two challenges. It helped me understand how to curve lines, and use the option key, which proved extremly useful when it came to designing my icons, as I hadn't used illustrator before.

### Icon Designs
The following are my desings for four of my icons, they go from monochromatic, and then a different colour is added for each design. I think for most of them the more monochromatic and less coloured designs were more effective. This is due to some of the icons being such simple icons, such as a fridge, which really needs no colour.
I think for the bed the red one was the most effective, this is because I feel like red is probably more synonymous with bedsheets than blue. Monochromatic was also better for the blue, as I could have added more colours with the pillowsm but it wasn't necessary to define the object as being a bed.
For the TV I went for monochromatic also, which is because I had such strong uses of shade with the white and black, I didn't think I needed any more colours in the mix.
Finally for the controller, I went with the most colourful design, as the colours were simply the buttons, so It wasn't too distracting regardless.

## Week 5 Session 2
I finalised my icons, considering my audience and their needs. Some things I edited where making some icons less broad, for instance I changed the garage icon to a car icon. As garage doesn't just represent a place to hold a car, it can mean a storage or a gym space too. This means my audience can easily identify this signifies cars and home transport, whereas the garage may not have been as clear. The car is also a much stronger and clearer image.
