#### This is the gate to the old Gaol, daunting. We at first thought the 'damned' meant the dead, but figured out it was those who found themselves on the wrong side of the law.

#### These are gorilla hands, nice! The easiest on the list to find.

#### This is a vending machine, boring. It does have some cooler snacks than others

#### These are the study pods that resemble Darth Vaders chamber, actually really cool.

#### This is the black box, we found it last, after another group told us where it was.

## 30 seconds of space

## Here is a link to a short editing experiment of mine: (https://vimeo.com/921667820)
When I first swapped footages with my classmate, I was shocked at how different both clips were. Mine was static, silent and without any movement in frame, whereas theres moved all through a space, was loud and had many moving elements, notably the people in the space. This extreme constrast inspired me to experiment with swapping the audios of both clips, so that the moving video was quiet, and the static video loud, as I was interested in the feelings this would envoke. After the swap I discovered that there was a very eerie vibe in the moving shot, and an unsettling vibe in the static cam, and I decided then that the aim of my experiement would be to create a strange, hostile environment, arising from the combination of two polar opposite spaces. I supported the effect of the audio swap by using slow motion, and finishing the clip with an abrupt, loud end, to make my viewer shocked and uncomfortable, and overall, I think I achieved at the creation of an unsettling atmosphere in my experiment.

These are the storyboards for my self portrait video. I will maintain continuity as I will have the recurring image of the face that morphs over time, showing its linear progression, while intercut with other objects. I will then maintain discontinuity, as at the climax of the video the face starts changing rapidly in a non-linear manner. I make this change to show to the audience how identity is not a simple concept such as the drawing of a face, but it is many faces that combine together to form a greater identity. The jarring cuts are also meant to surprise and agitate the audience, as this part of identity is more angry and uncontrollable, compared to the very controlled and calm face in the first part of the video.
