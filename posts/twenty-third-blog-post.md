#### Copyright
As I was doing some editing, I suddenly came to the realisation that my artwork of Batman was technically a depction of a copyrighted character, even though there was no logo present. I decided to not feature him at all due to the risk, but looked on the bright side that I could choose one of my own creations, probably better showing off my creativity.
