#### Copyright
As I was doing some editing, I suddenly came to the realisation that my artwork of Batman was technically a depction of a copyrighted character, even though there was no logo present. I decided to not feature him at all due to the risk, but looked on the bright side that I could choose one of my own creations, probably better showing off my creativity.

#### Colour Range and Object Selection
In one of my final learning experiences in this course, I learnt a valuable skill on Photoshop. This was the ability to select a certain colour of an image in Photoshop and remove it, or select an object and remove everything else. I learnt this as I wanted to find out how to take the characters from my artwork and scatter them about the figma page. Because of this new skill my figma page was greatly benefited, as it was ordained with my personal art style, It also gave me a skill I really value, as I will be able to do some really cool creations by combining my software knowledge with my physical art. An example of my messing about can be seen below.
