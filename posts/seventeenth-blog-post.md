#### Exporting
I exported my build to WebGL, however it was very buggy with the lights and so I exported a MacOS build as well, and this didn't have the same issues with the lights

#### World Building
My light source of the sun was a warm colour, however the sky was plain blue with no clouds, so I knew I needed to get a better skybox. I searched online for a free one and found a pack that included an afternoon-sky, with a setting sun and atmospheric clouds. I noticed that the new sky made all objects in my project look much more warm, which wasn't intended but fits with the nostalgic perspective of the school.

My project was progressing as lockers on one side of the hall, and windows into classrooms on the other side, but I thought not enough natural light was present in the build, so I decided to add a window on the locker-side too, which looks out onto the city, the setting of my old school.
