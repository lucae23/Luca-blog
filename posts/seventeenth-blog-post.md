#### Exporting
I exported my build to WebGL, however it was very buggy with the lights and so I exported a MacOS build as well, and this didn't have the same issues with the lights. I will upload the final version as a MacOS download.

#### World Building
My light source of the sun was a warm colour, however the sky was plain blue with no clouds, so I knew I needed to get a better skybox. I searched online for a free one and found a pack that included an afternoon-sky, with a setting sun and atmospheric clouds. I noticed that the new sky made all objects in my project look much more warm, which wasn't intended but fits with the nostalgic perspective of the school.

My project was progressing as lockers on one side of the hall, and windows into classrooms on the other side, but I thought not enough natural light was present in the build, so I decided to add a window on the locker-side too, which looks out onto the city, the setting of my old school.

I managed to complete the structure of my enviroment, copying the classroom and hallway three times, so it is one long space. My design is very effective at leading the player through the project, as I utilise many elements of space. This includes depth and plane, as the walls are long planes, that extend forward creating depth, inviting players to progress forward through the hallway, to reach the end of the space. I also use thresholds in my space. This was partly a problem-solving idea as light wasn't rendering from a certain distance, so walls in the hallway stopped this, however it also gives the player a chance to have break from the long, deep halls, to look out in the environment outside, and let the hallways change texture.
