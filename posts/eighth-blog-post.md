#### Thumbnail Sketch 1
![house sketches](/W01S1/almosthouse.png)
I did 20 thumbnail sketches of a 'house' in illustrator, that all had the similiar design of a box and a roof, and often a door. I think the most effective one is the house on the very bottom to the left, as it is one of the most simple, yet is so clear that it's a house, with all the shapes in the design being proportinate with eachother.

#### Thumbnail Sketch 2

For these sketches I decided to handdraw them instead of using illustrator, because it is easier for me at this stage. 

I think the best design for bed is the 4th one. It uses less shapes than some others where I included the bed legs too, and so I think structurally it is easier to look at and identify it.

I think the best design for the house is 2nd one. This is because it has much less lines that the other designs, which means the eye doesn't wander to too many shapes so they can quickly identify it as a house.

I think the best design for the fridge is the 1st one. It literally has just 2 shapes, making it very simple and clear, as I added some fridge magnet shapes to one design but all it does it make it more crowded.

I think the best design for the tv is the 2nd one. This one is close with the 1st design, but I went for the more retro TV, as the shape is more simple, being just a square instead of a rectangle and a stand. I feel it directs attention to be more compact, meaning the eye wanders around less.

I think the best design for the toilet is the 3rd one. It is symetrical and simple, whereas some others have a different perspective, and as all my other favourite icons are symettrical, I think this stays in line.

I think the best design for the garage is the 1st one. I couldnt think of too many options for this design, but this one in particular has minimal shapes making it simple, and the horizontal lines firmly stabilize the icon, and convey that it's a garage.

I think the best design for the hobby is the game controller. This is because the others are very cluttered with lines and are not symettrical, and the ones that are I don't think clearly conveys the topic of 'hobby'. The controller has a strong shape, with the curvy lines making it appear friendly and inviting.

I think the best design for the garden one is the 1st flower. The petals are curvy again conveying friendlyness, as opposed to the less organic designs that have jagged edges, and for the topic 'garden', it should look as organic as it can be.

I think the best design for the pet is the cat face. The dynamics of the circle face and triangle ears encapture the feelings we have about our pets, and the design is the most clear, as opposed to a bone or collar which can be interpreted much differently.
